When coded in any of these scripts, state 1 is holocentric and state 2 is monocentric.


analysis.rate.centromere-backbone1.R: This script is used to estimate rates of chromosome number evolution with the set of posterior distribution trees from backbone 1 (Misof)

analysis.rate.centromere-backbone2.R: This script is used to estimate rates of chromosome number evolution with the set of posterior distribution trees from backbone 2 (Rainford)

analysis.rate.orders.R: This script is used to estimate rates of chromosome number evolution in orders of insects with at least 20 tips represented on our phylogeny.

bootstrap.R: script that creates supplemental figure 3

fig.centromere.rates.R: script that creates figure 3

fig.comparison.of.backbones.R: script that creates supplemental figure 1

fig.data.R: script that creates figure 1

fig.order.rates.R: script that creates figure 2

functions.R: this file contains different helper functions that we used for either selecting among possible tip states for each mcmc run or for extracting info that is reported in the paper
